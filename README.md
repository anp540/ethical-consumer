#Ethical Consumer (Work in Progress)

#Overview
As someone who loves fashion and appreciates high-quality products, I want to help myself and others navigate the world of luxury brands with greater confidence and mindfulness. Ever since my trip to Paris a few months ago, brands like Bottega Venetta and Saint Laurent have sparked my fascination and have me dreaming of investing in their products. But before I spend the money I've earned, I want to ensure that the brands I support align with my values. I thought I could build a personalized ‘luxury brand investigator’ chatbot to explore the ethics and sustainability behind luxury brands, so that I and others can feel good about where our dollars go. 

Ethical Consumer is an AI infused backend project that provides detailed insights into the ethical and environmental practices of luxury brands. By entering a brand name, users will be able to retrieve key information including:
1. A summary of the brand’s origin and founders
2. An overview of the products the company is best known for
3. Any notable controversies, scandals, or incidents related to labor and ethics
4. An ethical practices rating covering child labor laws and fair labor practices
5. A sustainability rating which assesses the brand's environmental impact and eco-friendly practices

#Project Status
This project is a work in progress and currently in the early stages of development. The backend architecture is being developed and tested, with plans to implement a range of AI techniques to enhance the functionality and accuracy of the information provided. The goal is to continue exploring concepts of AI and eventually build the frontend. 

#Tech Stack & AI 
- Large Language Models (LLMs): generate structured responses and summaries
- APIs: fetch real-time data on ethical ratings, sustainability scores, and brand controversies
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): enhanced data retrieval and integration with LLMs
